# week1-Khan-ElBash

Repository for the portfolio website for Khan ElBash. Our name is derived from the
building we work in, Khan ElBasha, Nazareth, Israel, and Bash, the UNIX shell.

### What
This is the portfolio site, designed primarily for mobile and with phenomenal accessibility,
for the award-winning, multi-talented agency, Khan ElBash.
The sections will be:
- Introduction section: The name of our team (in big) and a brief introduction.
- About section: Includes further information about our team.
- Team section: Includes a profile for each member of our team, with links to their GitHub profiles.
- Contact section: A form for clients to contact the team.

### How
- First we discussed potential designs as a team.
- We decided on mobile first and the structure above.
- We split into pairs and wrote a basic initial README.
