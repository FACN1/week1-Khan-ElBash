# week1-Khan-ElBash

Repository for the portfolio website for Khan ElBash. Our name is derived from the
building we work in, Khan ElBasha, Nazareth, Israel, and Bash, the UNIX shell.

### Why ?!
So the main reason of making the website is to practice on making it and practicing on collaboration with others on making the website. Cause collaborating with others is the most important lesson to learn here, making websites faster, better, easier and more efficient.

### What ?!
This is the portfolio site, designed primarily for mobile and with phenomenal accessibility,
for the award-winning, multi-talented agency, Khan ElBash.
The sections will be:
- Introduction section: The name of our team (in big) and a brief introduction.
- About section: Includes further information about our team.
- Team section: Includes a profile for each member of our team, with links to their GitHub profiles.
- Contact section: A form for clients to contact the team.

### How ?!
- First we discussed potential designs as a team.
- We decided on mobile first and the structure above.
- We split into pairs and wrote a basic initial README.
